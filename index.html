            <h2>A bit about myself</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Itai Bar-Haim.</p>
            <p>
                I'm a Client-Oriented kind of guy, most of my experience is writing UI
                in various technologies (started with X-Motif, then GTK, QT, WinForms,
                WPF, Web, Some Android).
            </p>
            <p>
                Writing UI code gave me deep understanding of thread management,
                performance, and the importance of responsiveness. Also I had to handle
                a lot of different methods of user input and respond accordingly. UI
                libraries also have their share of memory issues (handles in Windows,
                for example), which I learnt how to tackle.
            </p>
            <p>After doing UI in the deep levels for so many years, server side is easy :-)</p>
            <p>
                I'm a fast learner, autodidact. If I want to learn something new, I just start
                a project with it. It also goes the other way around - if I need to do something
                using a technology I'm not familiar with, I just learn it "on-the-fly".
            </p>
            <p>
                I have the attitude of "Get-Things-Done-Right". This means that while I do get
                things done, I always try to do them the right way. In software this usually
                means I try to think ahead to allow room for future changes and adaptations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Married to Nadin and father to Ella.

            <p>
                When I have time I like (surprise surprise!) programming (my own projects), going to Escape Rooms with my wife or with friends,
                and when I have a good quest game I like solving it.
